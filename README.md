# The purpose of this project



This static website was made to provide information on Nikola Tesla as well as his personal life and inventions to interested third-party individuals. The language and layout of the site are aimed to be friendly and inviting regardless of the educational background of the interested individual or individuals.

The site contains a total of five sections including a contact section.

The target audience is individuals interested in Nikola Tesla - regardless of their geographic location and the website was made in English so that it would accommodate a larger audience.

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project are that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

### Requirements

A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.

Required technologies: HTML, CSS

### Design

This is my first project so I made multiple versions of it for esthetic and functionality testings - this submission is a culmination of all of those versions. There are parts of the projects which were influenced by various sources - they will be credited properly in this ReadME as well as the comments in the code.

This site was made as a single-page website that has been divided into multiple sections. I wanted the website to look like it has a flow and isn't difficult to use.

I chose to put a background picture as the only picture because I didn't want to slow down the loading times or mess up the functionality of the site.

The site has been divided into the following sections:

-   Home
    
-   Biography
    
-   Fun Facts
    
-   Famous Quotes
    
-   Contact

- Thank You Page
    

Also, the navigation on top has been programmed as static so that the users could quickly go to the subject they are interested in without scrolling.

#### Typography

The [Google Font Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) was chosen as the main font with a fallback of Sans-Serif. Font weight of 300 has been used on the website.

#### Image

Image has been chosen in accordance with color and content. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. The image has been sized in order for the page to be load up quicker.

-   A subscription area so that users can become members and receive updates on content.
    

### Technologies used

-   [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    
-   [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    

## Testing

Test of functionality and appearance of the website has been dealt with throughout all stages of the development phase.

The test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions have been conducted using Google DevTools.

Listed are the main issues discovered. (I did not document the details of the mistakes I did during the development of the website but will use the final fixing stage as an example):

 -   On smaller screens, the border boxes became fixed and did not adjust to the size of the screen and content as needed
    
I changed the values from Pixels into em and percentages

 -   The Navigation and Social Media icons become (start overlapping) distorted on smaller screens
    
   Added Margins and Padding to solve the problem
   

 - I had a problem with HTML code vadiation - after identifying the problem (the h1 heading was in the head element instead of the body)
 
 I relocated the h1 heading into the body and solved the problem

Apart from these issues, there have been several minor issues. The majority of these have been due to not putting the spaces, dashes, or other signs where necerassy.

In testing with the W3School Validator 0 issues popped up.

### Unfixed bugs

I curently fixed all the bugs that the site had.

## Development and Deployment

The development environment used for this project was GitPod in combination with JS Fiddle. To track the development stage and handle version control regular commits and pushes to GitHub has been conducted. The GitPod environment was created using a template provided by Code Institute.

The live version of the project is deployed on GitHub pages.

The procedure for deployment followed the "Creating your site" steps provided in [GitHub Docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

1.  Log into GitHub.
    
2.  Locate the GitHub Repository that shall be deployed live.
    
3.  At the top of the repository, select Settings from the menu items.
    
4.  Scroll down the Settings page to the ”GitHub Pages" section and click on the ”Check it out here!”
    
5.  At the ”Source” section choose ”main” as Branch and root as folder and click ”Save”
    
6.  The website will deploy and the pages refreshes to provide the live link to the project.
